abstract="Research Objects (ROs) are semantic aggregations of related scientific resources, their annotations and research context. They are meant to help scientists to refer to all the materials supporting their investigation. ROHub is a digital library system for ROs that supports their storage, lifecycle management and preservation. It provides a Web interface and a set of RESTful APIs enabling the sharing of scientific findings via ROs. Additionally, ROHub includes different features that help scientists throughout the research lifecycle to create and maintain high-quality ROs that can be interpreted and reproduced in the future. For instance, scientists can assess the conformance of an RO to a set of predefined requirements and create RO Snapshots, at any moment, to share, cite or submit to review the current state of research outcomes. ROHub can also generate nested ROs for workflow runs, exposing their content and annotations, and includes monitoring features that generate notifications when changes are detected.",
